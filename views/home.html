			The top of the page displays your stats such as population, CO2 level, and approval rating. You’ll campaign to raise money by clicking the large green button at the top of the page. It is important to make sure you don’t let the budget fall to 0! 
			There are 6 different types of energy plants, some of which cause CO2 emissions. Without going over budget, you must purchase plants to generate the required energy. Every ten seconds, a month passes in game. Every month you must cover the costs of running the plant, so make sure you’re clicking the green bar!
